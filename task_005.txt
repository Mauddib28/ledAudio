# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Hardware Integration for Pico W
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend hardware support to Pico W microcontroller
# Details:
Develop firmware for Pico W that interfaces with the main software. Create communication protocols between host and microcontroller. Implement fallback modes for limited capabilities. Ensure proper error handling for connection issues.

# Test Strategy:
Firmware testing on actual hardware, communication protocol validation, stress testing with continuous operation
