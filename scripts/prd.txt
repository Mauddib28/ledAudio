# LED Audio Project PRD

## Overview
The LED Audio Project aims to create a system that visualizes audio input through LED light patterns. The system will process audio input in real-time, extract features such as frequency and amplitude, and translate these features into visually appealing LED light patterns.

## Goals
- Create a responsive audio visualization system using LEDs
- Process audio input in real-time with minimal latency
- Develop various visualization patterns based on audio characteristics
- Create a user-friendly interface for controlling the system
- Support a wide range of audio formats and hardware configurations
