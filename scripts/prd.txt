# LED Audio Project PRD

## Overview
The LED Audio Project aims to create a system that visualizes audio input through LED light patterns. The system will process audio input in real-time, extract features such as frequency and amplitude, and translate these features into visually appealing LED light patterns.

## Goals
- Create a responsive audio visualization system using LEDs
- Process audio input in real-time with minimal latency
- Develop various visualization patterns based on audio characteristics
- Create a user-friendly interface for controlling the system

## Requirements
1. Audio Input Processing
   - Capture audio from microphone or line-in
   - Perform real-time audio analysis (FFT, amplitude detection)
   - Extract meaningful features from audio

2. LED Control System
   - Control LED strips with different patterns
   - Map audio features to visual parameters
   - Support various visualization modes

3. User Interface
   - Simple controls for selecting visualization modes
   - Adjustments for brightness, sensitivity, and color
   - Option to save and load custom settings

4. Hardware Integration
   - Support for Raspberry Pi and Pico W
   - Audio input device integration
   - Power management for LED strips

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core audio processing and basic LED control
- Phase 2: Enhanced visualization patterns and optimizations
- Phase 3: User interface development
- Phase 4: Testing and refinement
