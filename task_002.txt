# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Audio Processing and Analysis Engine
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build system for real-time audio analysis and feature extraction
# Details:
Implement Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis, amplitude detection, and feature extraction. Create components for identifying frequency bands, beats, and tempo. Optimize for low latency and efficient processing. Support adaptive buffer sizing to prevent underruns.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark tests for processing speed, accuracy tests with known audio samples, stress testing with complex audio
