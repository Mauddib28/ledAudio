# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create LED Control System
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop framework for controlling LED hardware with various patterns
# Details:
Build an abstraction layer for different LED hardware configurations. Implement core visualization patterns mapped to audio features. Create smooth transitions between states and proper initialization/shutdown sequences. Support virtual LED visualization for testing without hardware.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for pattern generators, mock hardware testing, visual verification of patterns
